<h1>Streamlit Data Dashboard Project</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project is an interactive data visualization dashboard built with Streamlit. I completed the full workflow—setting up the environment, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), building visualizations, and deploying the application using Render. The dashboard loads a CSV dataset and allows users to explore it through interactive charts and UI components.

<h2>App Webpage</h2>

On the sidebar, users can select both the vehicle condition and vehicle manufacturer. These selections dynamically feed into a groupby() operation, which calculates the average price for each vehicle type based on the chosen filters. The resulting bar chart updates in real time, allowing users to explore how condition and make influence the pricing of different vehicle categories. <br/>
